# ansible-aws-cloudwatch-agent
 ansible script for install cloudwatch agent


To install the CloudWatch Agent on a Linux server using Ansible, you can use the package module. Here's an example playbook that installs the CloudWatch Agent on a Linux host.

This playbook will:

Check if the CloudWatch Agent is already installed by checking for the presence of the /opt/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/bin/amazon-cloudwatch-agent file
If the CloudWatch Agent is not installed, install the dependencies required by the CloudWatch Agent (curl) using the package module
Download the CloudWatch Agent installer from Amazon's S3 bucket
Install the CloudWatch Agent using the package module
You can customize the arguments passed to the package module to control the installation process. For example, you can pass the -y argument to install the agent without prompting for confirmation.

After installing the CloudWatch Agent, you will need to configure it by creating a configuration file and starting the agent. You can use the lineinfile module to create the configuration file, and the service module to start the agent.

Here's an example playbook that creates a configuration file and starts the CloudWatch Agent:

Create the CloudWatch Agent configuration file at /opt/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/etc/amazon-cloudwatch-agent.json
Start the CloudWatch Agent using the service module
